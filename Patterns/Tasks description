Task 1. Creational patterns
The task is to use one of creational patterns from the article above in a practical data science task.

You are to analyze how train dataset size affects the score of your model. Thus, you're supposed to create subsamples based on the initial dataset.

As part of this task, you may train classical linear regression on the iris dataset. (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html)

It's necessary to print a range of subsample sizes and corresponding model scores.
